RomVaultX
=========
Reads DATS great now.

Database is hard coded right now to:
C:\stage\romX.db

(as my C drive is an SSD and it really makes a big difference running the DB on an SSD.)

other than that:
DATRoot
ROMRoot
ToSort

should all be in the same DIR as the ROMVaultX.exe

Will read in .zip and non zip file right now.



ToDo:
-----
Lots and lots. To Many to List just yet.

But high on the list now is:

Analyze DAT's to find Merged files.

Improve internal .gz data storage.

Add secondary Hash checking. (to support CHD's and No-Intro header DAT's)
