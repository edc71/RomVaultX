RomVaultX
=========
Reads DATS great now.
Can add more DATS, does not delete DATS yes.

Database is hard coded right now to:
C:\stage\romX.db

(as my C drive is an SSD and it really makes a big difference running the DB on an SSD.)

other than that:
DATRoot
ROMRoot
ToSort

should all be in the same DIR as the ROMVaultX.exe

Will read in .zip and non zip file right now.



ToDo:
-----
Lots and lots. To Many to List just yet.

But high on the list now is:

Checking for removed DAT's
Added DAT's need there files checked to see if we already have them.
Add Color and numbers reporting back into UI.

Analyze DAT's to find Merged files.
Extracting files in a DAT back out to ZIP files.

Improve internal .gz data storage.

Add secondary Hash checking. (to support CHD's and No-Intro header DAT's)
